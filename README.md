# GMBlacklist

A little tool that helps GMs to blacklist spam messages. During the last years, gold-sellers started to use exotic UTF-8 characters that look like latin ones to bypass word-filters. Those messages/symbols are often hard to type into the ChatFrame in order to blacklist them. This simple addon allows to copy and cut the raw messages and send them directly to the blacklist.
